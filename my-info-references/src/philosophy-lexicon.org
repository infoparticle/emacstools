Lexicon for clear thinking

* Definitions

** Action
:PROPERTIES:
:NUMBERED: notoc
:END:
*** Dilemma vs Choice

forced to pick equally awful choices!

eg: painful radiation therapy or drugs that cause kidney failure.

*** Choice

The ability to pick the alternatives in a non automatic way.

An option; a decision; an opportunity to choose or select something, based on your value judgment.
No penalty attached.

You have the option to drink lime juice, tea or coffee, pick whatever you like as per weather/mood.

*** Freewill

#+CINDEX: Freewill
#+CINDEX: Volition

Capability of mind.

The ultimate choice is to focus or not focus/evade your mind, the rest automatically follows..

Can some one choose to focus their mind and choose to evade? yes.

*** Volition

#+CINDEX: freewill
#+CINDEX: Volition

Not happening automatically unlike heart beat or digestion. Man must choose to focus.

** Relationship
:PROPERTIES:
:NUMBERED: notoc
:END:
*** Love

You are falling back into you, when all your 'stuff' are not blocking you.

*** Sex

#+CINDEX: sex
#+CINDEX: love

Integration of mind, body and virtues.

Concrete reflection of values and virtues you have achieved.
A conscious mirror of the soul!

** Emotions
:PROPERTIES:
:NUMBERED: notoc
:END:
*** Happiness

#+CINDEX: Happiness

**** Objectivism
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: notoc
:END:


State of mind.


Happiness is the successful state of life, pain is an agent of death. Happiness
is that state of consciousness which proceeds from the achievement of one's
values.

A morality that dares to tell you to find happiness in the renunciation of your
happiness--to value the failure of your values--is an insolent negation of
morality.

**** Yoga
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: notoc
:END:

Not being closed/blocking to the flow of life energy.

The more resistance to the flow, the greater the neurosis and suffering.
